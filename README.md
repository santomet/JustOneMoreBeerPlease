# JustOneMoreBeerPlease
Simple and Android app (C++/QML) as a interface for school project. Note that this has been made in a few hours hurry and the lack of structure and poor readability are kind of intentional.

Howdy how! I am slightly surprised that you're actually reading this :) Because the PA181 is 4 credits (ECTS) and the requirements are, in my opinion, much higher than they should be, I made sure that I did NOT invest more time to PA181 than to any other 4 credits subject. Despite this, the result (app itself, not the code!) exceeded even my expectations. I hope you didn't expect more. Anyway... Have a nice day and all hail to SSME!
