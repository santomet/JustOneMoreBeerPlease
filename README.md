# JustOneMoreBeerPlease
Simple Android app (C++/QML) as a interface for school project. Note that this has been made in a few hours hurry and the lack of structure and poor readability are kind of intentional.

# To Mouzhi, Leo and (other) IBM guys
Howdy how! I am slightly surprised that you're actually reading this :) Because the PA181 is 4 credits, I made sure that I did NOT invest more time to PA181 than to any other 4 credits subject. Which is circa 10 hours (+ some lectures). So if you're about to read the code, just don't. Please. It is awful. Despite this, the result (app itself) exceeded even my expectations. I hope you didn't expect more, although the IBM judges seemed like they wanted to see some "real" projects and not this rubbish made purely for the sake of passing the subject. Anyway... Have a nice day and all hail to SSME!

## Update!
The guys actually never read this readme :( But we somehow managed to win the second place in the IBM competition with it. Fairly strange to be honest.
